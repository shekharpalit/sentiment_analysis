# sentiment_analysis
sentiment analysis using LSTM cells and bidirectional RNN cells 
The goal of this project is to create an efficient model for sentiment analysis using LSTM cells.

## Model creation
- Deep Learning Framework - Pytorch
- For data preprocessing - spaCy toolkit
- Dataset - IMDB
- Techniques - bidirectional LSTM cells 
- used pretrained weights glove.6B.100d to improve the model accuracy.
